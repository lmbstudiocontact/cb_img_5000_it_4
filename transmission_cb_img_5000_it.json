    "In the first period the traditional ways of transferring property - transfer at death, retirement and remarriage - constituted 44 per cent of all transmissions.",

    "Table 10 shows the purchase prices in different types of land transmissions.",
    "Collectively, this information provides a meaningful inter pretation of past climate that has been passed down through written and oral transmissions.",
    "The large motors and high gear-ratio transmissions used in the joints of powerful manipulators result in high friction, which in turn results in tracking errors, stick-slip, and other undesired behaviors.",
    "Factors that affect planning in a knowledge-based system for mechanical engineering design optimization with application to the design of mechanical power transmissions.",
    "The difference in performance among these cars will be due to their different transmissions.",
    "Proprioceptive impairment is possible in the presence of normal motor function because the higher frequency of impulse transmissions in proprioceptive fibres render them more susceptible to blockade by local anaesthetics."
