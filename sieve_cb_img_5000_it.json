    "At examination, intestines were opened along their lengths and the contents collected over a series of staked sieves with pore sizes of 2 mm, 1 mm and 0.5 mm.",
    "Extraction of the macroscopic plant remains involved the wet sieving of 500 cm3 of sediment through a nest of sieves down to 150 m mesh size.",
    "At the very least it might refer to multiple staves; as another possibility, we may need two sieves, one for tonal and the other for mensural behaviour.",
    "At planting, the seeds were mixed with finely sieved sand in the ratio of 1:99 (seed:sand) by weight.",
    "The sand was sieved and washed, and the fraction retained between sieves of 160 m and 425 m pore size was used.",
    "A certain number of these resting larvae may be induced to pupate by sieving and addition of fresh food, but some resist all stimulation and die without any further development."
