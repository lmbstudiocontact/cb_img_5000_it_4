    "Virtual simulation also enables complex treatment plans to be explored, unlike the conventional simulator.",
    "The proposed manipulator has a wide application in the fields of industrial robots, simulators, micro-motion manipulators, and parallel kinematics machines.",
    "Aspects of touch and kinaesthesis require physical and spatial interaction with the environment generated by the simulator.",
    "An arbitrary number of nonreal-time simulators can be run simultaneously and may be spread across a network encompassing multiple clusters of workstations.",
    "Now this type of kinematic structure seems to be widely accepted for the design of commercially used flight simulators.",
    "In our department, we need to have confidence in the reproducibility of our techniques before we can eliminate the use of simulator.",
    "However, by definition, a simulator represents an abstract representation of the real-world environment and it is desirable to validate simulation results with real-world hardware.",
    "Such simulator software allows one to generate virtual worlds where the dynamic objects can be manipulated, and the reaction forces are calculated."
