    "The shape of the variance -mean relation suggests that in bright light transmitter release approaches zero, while in darkness transmitter release saturates the postsynaptic response.",
    "Moreover, the transmitters have to present themselves as trustworthy agents so that their messages will be taken seriously.",
    "This leaves the possibility of electrical synapses or a second type of transmitter.",
    "A portion of the transmitters (factor r) returns from the synaptic cleft into the presynaptic hair cell.",
    "In addition, they are sensitive to neuronal activity by expressing various transmitter receptors.",
    "In effect the cone bipolar cell counts every vesicle released, thus allowing synaptic transfer to be encoded by much lower transmitter release rates.",
    "Most of our arguments concerning vertical transmission require only transgenerational transmission, and relate to the temporal distance between the learning of transmitter and receiver.",
    "It is known that exogenous application of a transmitter activates both synaptic and extrasynaptic receptors."
