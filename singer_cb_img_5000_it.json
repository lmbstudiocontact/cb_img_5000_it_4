    "This was not ordinary domestic vocal music for an ordinary female singer.",
    "That such a question can be raised challenges the vocal presence of the singer.",
    "The singers prove variously incorrigible, and the control room has to accept less than adequate performances from them, which are emended through electronic intervention.",

    "There are no lyrics; rather the singer uses neo-syllables2 to complement lyrical sounds on the saxophone.",
    "His intent focus on the singer's offstage poise suggests how much he has yet to learn about striking a pose and deflecting the gaze.",
    "There is a live performer, a soprano singer, and an obligatory electronic part.",
    "It is perceptually important, as it helps the singer's voice to be heard when the orchestral accompaniment is loud."
