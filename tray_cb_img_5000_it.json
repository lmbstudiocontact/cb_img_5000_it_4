    "The dishes were stored on shallow trays and were placed inside a plastic bag to retain moisture.",
    "The trays were placed in a glasshouse and watered regularly.",
    "Levels of relative humidity were maintained within the range of 60-80% by providing free water in trays in the cabinets when necessary.",
    "The trays had continuous slow water flow and exchange.",
    "The water was changed every second day, and trays of cups were rotated systematically to minimize incubator position effects.",
    "Consequently, all the germination experiments reported here used open shaded trays with moist soil as described above.",
    "Specimens then fell into a preserving solution set (containing chloral hydrate) with detergent (to reduce water tension) in aluminium-foil trays positioned beneath the net."
