    "That is to pay town halls for the nonsensical way in which they produced all their bills only to put them in the shredder.",
    "Leaf preferences were similar for all shredder species, suggesting that preferences for different leaf species do not provide a mechanism for resource partitioning among the shredders.",
    "When offered a choice between different combinations of leaf species and conditioning stage, all shredders actively sought leaves at advanced stages of conditioning, largely avoiding less conditioned or unconditioned leaves.",
    "Both species constructed their cases from leaf species that were not preferred for feeding, possibly as a behavioural adaptation to prevent attacks from other shredders."
